We looked at competitors like "Pandora", "YouTube", "Google Play Music", and "Sound Cloud"; With innovation in mind for the bettering of our customers, we created pursuit radio. "Pandora", "Google Play Music", it's confusing to upload music, "YouTube" and "Sound Cloud" have easier uploading processes, but limit it's potential of the radio business. "Sound Cloud", is unavailable for iOS devices, and to listen to music with your device off "YouTube" forces you to pay a monthly fee. Well Pursuit Radio is easy, free, and still innovating.
